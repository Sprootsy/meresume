Somewhere in time I thought I would spend some time writing this website
about me and some stuff I do. The chances that I will never be consistent
in working on it are very very high...

## Developer guide
This website is built in react to run with github pages.

### Build, Test and Run 
```bash
cd web
yarn build
yarn test
yarn start
```
Run with Jekyll.
```bash
bundle exec jekyll clean && bundle exec jekyll serve
```
